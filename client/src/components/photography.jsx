          <p>
            Photography Editing is a manipulation and enhancement of images
            using software tools after they have been captured with a camera.
            Photographic editing allows photographers to correct imperfections,
            enhance specific features, and apply creative effects, ultimately
            shaping the final appearance of the image. This process empowers
            photographers to correct flaws, enhance features, and add creative
            elements, contributing to the final, polished image. In essence,
            photographic editing is a transformative stage where the
            photographerâ€™s vision comes to life through digital refinement.
